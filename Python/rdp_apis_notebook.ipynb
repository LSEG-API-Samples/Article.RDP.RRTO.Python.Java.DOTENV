    "# How to separate your credentials, secrets, and configurations from your source code with environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id=\"intro\"></a>Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As a modern application, your application always deal with credentials, secrets and configurations to connect to other services like Authentication service, Database, Cloud services, Microservice, ect. It is not a good idea to keep your username, password and other credentials hard code in your source code as your credentials may leak when you share or publish the application. You need to delete or remark those credentials before you share the code which adds extra work for you. And eventually, you may forgot to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The services configurations such as API endpoint, Database URL should not be embedded in the source code too. The reason is every time you change or update the configurations you need to modify the code which may lead to more errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "How should we solve this issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"\"></a>Store config in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Twelve-Factor App methodology](https://12factor.net/) which is one of the most influential pattern to designing scalable software-as-a-service application. The methodology [3rd factor](https://12factor.net/config) (aka Config principle) states that configuration information should be kept as environment as environment variables and injected into the application on runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables (often shortened to env vars or env). Env vars are easy to change between deploys without changing any code; unlike config files, there is little chance of them being checked into the code repo accidentally; and unlike custom config files, or other config mechanisms such as Java System Properties, they are a language- and OS-agnostic standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to .ENV file and dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "The dotenv method lets the application loads variables from a ```.env``` file into environment/running process the same way as the application load variables from environment variables. The application can load or modify the environment variables from the OS and ```.env``` file with a simple function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "[dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) is a library that originates from [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) developers (especially the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework) and has been widely adopted and ported to many programming languages such as [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv), [dotenv-java](https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java), [Node.js](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```.env``` file is a simple text file locates at the root of the project with a key-value pair setting as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# DB\n",
    "DB_USER=User\n",
    "DB_PASSWORD=MyPassword\n",
    "# Cloud\n",
    "CLOUD_URL=192.168.1.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**:\n",
    "You *should not* share this ```.env``` file to your peers or commit/push it to the version control. You should add the file to the ```.gitignore``` file to avoid adding it to a version control or public repo accidentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook application demonstrate how to use python-dotenv library to store and read the [Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP) APIs](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis) credentials and configurations, then request the RDP data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"whatis_rdp\"></a>What is Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP) APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP) APIs](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis) provide various Refinitiv data and content for developers via easy to use Web based API.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDP APIs give developers seamless and holistic access to all of the Refinitiv content such as Historical Pricing, Environmental Social and Governance (ESG), News, Research, etc and commingled with their content, enriching, integrating, and distributing the data through a single interface, delivered wherever they need it.  The RDP APIs delivery mechanisms are the following:\n",
    "* Request - Response: RESTful web service (HTTP GET, POST, PUT or DELETE) \n",
    "* Alert: delivery is a mechanism to receive asynchronous updates (alerts) to a subscription. \n",
    "* Bulks:  deliver substantial payloads, like the end of day pricing data for the whole venue. \n",
    "* Streaming: deliver real-time delivery of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example project is focusing on the Request-Response: RESTful web service delivery method only.  \n",
